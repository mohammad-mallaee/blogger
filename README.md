# Blogger
This is a blog template ( maybe a little more ), which you can spin up and write what matters to you. This project is heavily inspired by overreacted blog written by Dan Abramov as I admired the simplicity and I think it's beautiful :)

## Features
- **Math writing support:** Effortlessly integrate mathematical expressions into your posts.
- **Right-to-left language support**: Cater to a wider audience with seamless language compatibility.
- **Easy configuration and customization**: Tailor the blog to your preferences with ease.
- **Tailwind CSS integration:** Style your blog elements using the popular Tailwind framework.
- **And more!**
