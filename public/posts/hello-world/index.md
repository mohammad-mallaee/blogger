Here begins the journey, or so-called `Hello World!`

As you read this post and think to yourself, "Oh, I'm going to write some cool articles and show them to the world," many things are happening in the world of which you are a part.

Some of them change your life a bit, and some of them turn your whole story in another direction. And here you are, on your way to creating a new blog, who knows what it will turn into?

**So let's begin**. First of all, who is this for?

I created this template (or maybe a little more than a template) for those who want a simple, beautiful blog (with some features too, obviously) that is easy to deploy, write in, and keep all their data for themselves.

### Get Started
Here are the steps you need to take to have your own blog and start writing:

- Clone or fork the repository
- Configure the blog with the proper data
- Create your first article or post
- Deploy it wherever you want

You can read through the [getting started](/posts/getting-started) post for a step-by-step guide.

Good luck!
