## Markdown editing

Blogger uses markdown to show the content.

If you're new to markdown, I recommend this brief crash course: [Markdown Crash Course](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/)

You can write html in your markdown files too, they will compile without additional configuration.

```html
<p className="text-orange-500">I'm an orange text</p>
```
<p className="text-orange-500">I'm an orange text</p>

You may have noticed that I used __tailwind__ to style the element :)

## Writing Codes

Markdown allows for code inclusion, and Blogger utilizes "rehype pretty code" for enhanced features like line/word highlighting and line numbers.

For more info on how to add these features to your code block follow the link below.
